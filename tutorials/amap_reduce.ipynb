The Dow Jones Industrial Average daily closing value was plotted on a log-10 scale, indicating a significant fluctuation. News articles suggested that Washington may have had a hand in keeping the Dow meltdown from being a complete disaster, with the Dow tumbling to a loss of about 1,600 points at one point. However, it was also reported that the U.S. stock markets had a historically bad day with major losses in both the Dow Jones and NASDAQ as investors feared the impacts from President Donald Trump’s tariff plan. Additionally, history shows that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has generated an average monthly decline of 1.1% in September and finished higher only 42.2% of the time dating back to 1897. The daily range of the Dow Jones Industrial Average on this day was 12.924443321266926, indicating high volatility. The opening value was 8568.669922, the high was 8901.280273, the low was 7882.509766, and the closing value was 8451.19043. The volume of trades was 674920000....\n",

However, the news articles provided do not give a clear reason for the market's performance on this specific day. Most of the news articles are general information about the Dow Jones Industrial Average, its history, and its role in the stock market. Some articles mention past events, such as a 1,175-point loss in the Dow Jones industrial average, but these events are not related to the specific date of 2008-11-13. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is not possible to give a specific reason for the market's performance on this day.

However, the close price being higher than the open price indicates a positive movement in the market. The daily range of 11.099450382090795 also indicates high volatility, but the market still managed to close higher. The news articles also mention the collapse of large financial institutions, such as Lehman Brothers and Bear Sterns, which could have contributed to the volatility. Additionally, some news articles mention a potential market meltdown, but the close price on this day suggests that the market was still able to recover and close higher.

The crash, which represented a plunge of over 9% within a short period, wiped off over $1 trillion in market value in less than 30 minutes. However, the market rebounded rapidly, with the Dow recovering to close down 348 points at 10,520.32. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 37.75 points, or 3.24 percent, to close at 1,128.15, and the Nasdaq was down 82.65 points, or 3.44 percent, at 2,319.64. The event was caused by erroneous trading in Procter & Gamble and several other stocks, which led to a chain reaction of selling that resulted in the flash crash. The crash was the largest single-day drop in market history and caused an immediate media frenzy, with news outlets reporting on the event extensively in the following weeks....\n",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 9,000 for the first time in five years, and the S&P 500 lost approximately 50% of its value. The crisis was triggered by a speculative bubble, which led to a massive sell-off of stocks, resulting in unprecedented panic in the US stock market. The effects of the crisis rippled through the American economy for years, fundamentally changing how banks operate, how homes are bought and sold, and how the government regulates Wall Street. The human toll was staggering, with the crisis destroying $16.4 trillion of American households' net worth and wiping out more than $2 trillion of Americans' retirement savings....\n",

The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted nearly 700 points in the first ten minutes of trading, and the government reported that output by the nation's factories had decreased. However, the market later surged in the last hour, with the Dow Jones industrials closing up 401 points, and the major indexes also seeing broad gains. The volatility in the stock market was high, with a daily range of 9.95%, and the volume was 422,450,000. The news reported that worries over the economy had spread, and global markets had sunk, with stock prices falling globally, credit markets remaining tight, and oil prices declining to a 14-month low.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 445 points in the last minutes of the trading session, closing at 7,552, the lowest point in years. This was attributed to various factors, including the plunge in oil prices, which dropped below $50 a barrel, and the overall economic uncertainty. The news articles from reputable sources such as CNBC, Bloomberg, and NPR reported a significant decline in the stock market, with the Dow Jones industrial average shedding 444.99 points, or 5.6 percent, to 7552.29, its lowest close since March 2003. The Nasdaq lost 5.1 percent to close at 1316.12, and the broad S&P 500 index also declined. The stock market crash of 2008 was not over yet, with December 2008 seeing further declines.
